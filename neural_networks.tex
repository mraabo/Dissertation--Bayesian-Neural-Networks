\chapter{Neural Networks}
Neural networks are machine learning algorithms inspired by the biological neural network that constitute the brain. The neural network is a collection of nodes called neurons that transmits and processes signals to and from other neurons connected to it, much like the biological neural network. The goal of a neural network is to approximate some function by learning parameters that results in the best approximation.

The most simple neural networks are called feedforward neural networks or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). They are called feedforward as information flows in one direction through the neurons. Such a model is shown in figure ...
